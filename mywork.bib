    decision to select metallic fuel as the reference core for its sodium-cooled
    fast reactors (SFRs), such as PRISM (Power Reactor Inherently Safe Module),
    is based on the fuel’s physical properties, manufacturability, and accident
    response. The ideal fuel for a fast reactor has high thermal conductivity, a
    high melting temperature, chemical compatibility with the coolant,
    dimensional stability during irradiation, high fissile atom density, and few
    moderating atoms. Though each material has unique benefits, metallic fuel
    was chosen because 1) its high heat transport capability throughout its
    irradiation life, while still maintaining similar margin to melt as oxide
    fuel, 2) it is completely compatible with the coolant, making run beyond
    cladding breach a feasible operational strategy, and 3) it avoids the
    potential for core-wide boiling by providing a lower accident condition fuel
    centerline temperature and low Doppler reactivity feedback in stabilization
    of the core power during transient events. Metallic fuel is judged to have a
    more robust implementation for multiple SFR missions due to the relatively
    limited impact on overall thermo-mechanical properties with varying isotopic
    content, and therefore aligns PRISM better with the GEN-IV and PRISM’s
    original design goals of economic power generation, transuranic recycle and
    plutonium disposition, which in turn makes the commercialization of an
    advanced SFR possible in the near-term.",
